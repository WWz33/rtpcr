Description: This package performs statistical analysis and graphical presentation of real-time PCR (quantitative PCR  or qPCR) data. Various analysis methods are employed for real-time PCR data to measure the mRNA levels under different experimental conditions. the package handles amplification efficiency calculation and statistical analysis of real-time PCR data based on up to two reference gene. By accounting for amplification efficiency values, 'iqpcr' was developed using a general calculation method described by Ganger et al. <doi:10.1186/s12859-017-1949-5>, covering both the Livak and Pfaffl methods. Based on the experimental conditions, the functions of this package package use t-test (for experiments with a two-level factor) or analysis of variance (for cases where more than two levels or factors exist) to calculate the fold change or relative expression. The functions also provide standard deviations and confidence limits for means, apply statistical mean comparisons, and present letter mean grouping. Different datasets have been used in the examples and the outputs are explained. An outstanding feature of 'iqpcr' is providing publication-ready bar plots with various controlling arguments for experiments with up to three different factors.
